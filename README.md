# Components/Plugins for Blazor
Blazor UI is a lightweight, extensible, open-source and cross-platform component library for building modern applications built on top of [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor), [Reactive Extensions for .NET](https://github.com/dotnet/reactive) and CSS frameworks like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) and Material. It is created to provide an optimized development framework for apps that are built in Blazor. It consists of modular components with minimal overhead, so you retain flexibility while constructing your solutions.
