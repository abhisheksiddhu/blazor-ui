# Contribution Guidelines
General contribution guidance is included in this document. Additional guidance is defined in the documents linked below.

## Open Development

All work on Blazor UI happens directly on GitHub. All external contributors must send pull requests which will go through the review process.

## DOs and DON'Ts
Please do:

- **DO** follow our [coding style](#coding-guidelines) 
- **DO** give priority to the current style of the project or file you're changing even if it diverges from the general guidelines.
- **DO** include tests when adding new features. When fixing bugs, start with adding a test that highlights how the current behavior is broken.
- **DO** keep the discussions focused. When a new or related topic comes up it's often better to create new issue than to side track the discussion.

Please do not:

- **DON'T** make PRs for style changes.
- **DON'T** surprise us with big pull requests. Instead, file an issue and start a discussion so we can agree on a direction before you invest a large amount of time.
- **DON'T** commit code that you didn't write. If you find code that you think is a good fit to add to the project, file an issue and start a discussion before proceeding.

## Pull Requests
* **DO** submit all code changes via pull requests (PRs) rather than through a direct commit. PRs will be reviewed and potentially merged by the repo maintainers after a peer review that includes at least one maintainer.
* **DO NOT** submit "work in progress" PRs.  A PR should only be submitted when it is considered ready for review and subsequent merging by the contributor.
* **DO** give PRs short-but-descriptive names (e.g. "Improve code coverage for Authentication Service by 10%", not "Fix #1234")
* **DO** refer to any relevant issues, and include [keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) that automatically close issues when the PR is merged.
* **DO** tag any users that should know about and/or review the change.
* **DO** ensure each commit successfully builds.  The entire PR must pass all tests in the Continuous Integration (CI) system before it'll be merged.
* **DO** address PR feedback in an additional commit(s) rather than amending the existing commits, and only rebase/squash them when necessary.  This makes it easier for reviewers to track changes.
* **DO** assume that ["Squash and Merge"](https://github.com/blog/2141-squash-your-commits) will be used to merge your commit unless you request otherwise in the PR.
* **DO NOT** fix merge conflicts using a merge commit. Prefer `git rebase`.
* **DO NOT** mix independent, unrelated changes in one PR. Separate real product/test code changes from larger code formatting/dead code removal changes. Separate unrelated fixes into separate PRs, especially if they are in different assemblies.

## Commit Messages
Please format commit messages as follows (based on [A Note About Git Commit Messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)):

```
#[ticket_id], #[ticket_id_2] Summarize change in 50 characters or less

Provide more detail after the first line. Leave one blank line below the
summary and wrap all lines at 72 characters or less.

If the change fixes an issue, leave another blank line after the final
paragraph and indicate which issue is fixed in the specific format
below.

Fix #[ticket_id]
```

Also do your best to factor commits appropriately, not too large with unrelated things in the same commit, and not too small with the same small change applied N times in N different commits.

## Branch Organization

Development branches follows the naming based on the milestone version number. For example if the milestone is `1.2.3` the main develop branch will be named `dev-1.2.3` and all feature branches will be based on `dev-1.2.3`. Feature branches follows the naming `dev-1.2.3-feature-name`.

After the development for all the features are done in the milestone dev branch it will be squash merged into the `main` trunk branch.

### Branching Policies
- All branches will be deleted as soon as it gets merged back to it's parent branch
- All code to master branch can only go through a Pull request to facilitate code review and prevent accidental check-ins
- Pull Requests to master branch can be self-approved by maintainers.
- All Pull Requests will do a squash merge.
